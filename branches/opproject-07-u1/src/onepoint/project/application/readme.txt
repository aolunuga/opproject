Onepoint Project 07 Basic Edition (BETA)
========================================

Welcome to the most current release of the Onepoint Project Basic Edition.
This package contains the Open Source desktop version of Onepoint Project 07
("Basic Edition") together with a short user tutorial.


System Requirements
-------------------

* Microsoft Windows 2000/XP, Linux or Mac OS X

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.4.2 or higher


Documentation
-------------

The ZIP package contains a tutorial about Onepoint Project which explains
the most important functions step by step. The tutorial is provided in the
form of an Acrobat/PDF file -- you can use Adobe's Acrobat Reader or a
Web browser with the Acrobat Reader plug-in (typically, your Web browser
already contains such a plug-in). In case you do not have Acrobot Reader
installed, you can download it for free from the Adobe website:

   hhttp://www.adobe.com ("Get Adobe Reader")


Installation
------------

Installing Onepoint Project is very easy: Simply extract the ZIP package into a
file system folder of your choice, e.g., "C:\Program Files\Onepoint Project" on
Microsoft Windows or the "Application" folder on Mac OS X. Make sure that you have
downloaded the correct package for your operating system.

On first startup you will be asked by the application where you want to store your
Onepoint Project repository. After you have confirmed the default location or
entered a different location of your choice, the application will remember it
for subsequent startups.


Starting the Application
------------------------

In order to start the application on Microsoft Windows, double-click on the
"opproject.exe" application file. The Mac OS X application is called
"Onepoint Project".


Demo Data
---------

On first startup of the application you will be asked whether you want to load
a demo data set or not. The demo data is stored as an XML backup file located in
the directory "demodata" inside your Onepoint Project installation -- using the
repository tool you can also restore it later on if you want to.
