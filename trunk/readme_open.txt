Onepoint Project 7.1 Open Edition

=================================



Welcome to the most current release of Onepoint Project Open Edition. This

package contains the Web application archive (WAR) of Onepoint Project together

with a short user tutorial.



Please note that all installation steps in this document assume that you are

using Tomcat and MySQL under Windows XP/Vista/2003 Server. If you are using

Linux or Mac OS X, or a different application server or database you will have to

adjust the installation steps according to your environment.



IMPORTANT: If you encounter a warning message on the login screen stating that your

Onepoint Project installation is running against a non-transactional database

please be sure to read Appendix E and follow the database upgrading steps there

before putting any more data into your project repository.

Documentation

-------------



The ZIP package contains a tutorial about Onepoint Project which explains

the most important functions step by step. The tutorial is provided in the

form of an Acrobat/PDF file -- you can use Adobe's Acrobat Reader or a

Web browser with the Acrobat Reader plug-in (typically, your Web browser

already contains such a plug-in). In case you do not have Acrobot Reader

installed, you can download it for free from the Adobe website:



   http://www.adobe.com ("Get Adobe Reader")





Installation

------------



If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Onepoint Project 07 or 06.1 Open

Edition please move your existing "opproject" web application from the "webapps"

folder to a different location in the folder hierarchy.



These short instructions assume that Onepoint Project is installed as a Tomcat Web

application:



1. Install Tomcat (if an installation does not yet exist)



2. Copy the "opproject.war" file from the ZIP package to the "wepapps" folder inside

the Tomcat installation. If you used an English language installer it is typically:



   C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps



Slightly afterwards or after you restart Tomcat, a folder "opproject" should appear

inside the webapps folder.



3. Copy the MySQL JDBC driver (JAR file) into the opproject\WEB-INF\lib folder



4. Install the MySQL database software and create an instance

   - Use UTF-8/Unicode as the default charset ("best support for multilingual...")



5. Create the MySQL database user ("opproject") and database ("opproject")

   - See Appendix A if you do not know how to do this in MySQL



6. If you upgraded from a previous version of Onepoint Project copy your

configuration file ("configuration.oxc.xml") to the new installation path



7. Stop Tomcat and restart it in order to make sure that the JDBC driver gets loaded

and your previous configuration file is loaded (in case you provided one).





Starting the Application

------------------------



If you installed Tomcat using the default settings then Onepoint Project should

be accessible by using the following URL:



   http://localhost:8080/opproject/service



If you did not upgrade from a previous installation you will now be presented with

the configuration wizard where you have to choose your database type (e.g., MySQL),

provide a JDBC connect string for your database instance, a database user and a

password. If you are not familiar with JDBC connect strings please take a look at

Appendix C.



This is also the step where you can select if you want to load the demo data.



Pleae note that for a totally new installation it can take a couple of minutes

until the repository structure is set up completely.



You can now log in as "administrator", there is no password set as default.

Please note that the first thing you should do now is to specify a password

for the administrator user: You can do this under "My" -> "Preferences".



IMPORTANT: If you encounter a warning message on the login screen stating that your

Onepoint Project installation is running against a non-transactional database

please be sure to read Appendix E and follow the database upgrading steps there

before putting any more data into your project repository.





Using the Demo Data

-------------------



Log in as test user "cs" for a German user interface, or as "tw" for English.

Neither one of the test users has a password set. In order to gain

administrative access, you have to log in as user "administrator"; note that

also there no password is set.



Please note that only two projects really contain actual data: "Virtual

Cockpit v2" and "Einbau ALS/Xplore". The users tw and cs have only manager

permissions on these two projects, otherwise you have to use the

administrator user.





Appendix A: Creating a New Database and a New Database User in MySQL

--------------------------------------------------------------------



In order to create a new database with the default values you can simply

execute the following steps after installing MySQL:



   (1) Open a command line window (DOS shell) und change into the "demodata"

       directory

   (2) Type "mysql -u root -p" and enter the root password which you specified

       when installing MySQL

   (3) mysql> source createdb.sql;

   (4) mysql> quit



Alternatively, you can create a new database and a new user in MySQL also

manually:



   (1) Open a command line window (DOS shell) und type "mysql -u root -p" and

       enter the root password which you specified when installing MySQL

   (2) mysql> create database opproject;

   (3) mysql> grant all privileges on opproject.* to 'opproject'@'localhost'

       identified by 'opproject' with grant option;

   (4) mysql> quit





Appendix B: Executing a SQL file in MySQL

-----------------------------------------



In order to execute a SQL file in MySQL you have to do the following:



   (1) Open a command line window (DOS shell) und type

       "mysql ï¿½u opproject -p opproject" and enter the password you specified

       when creating the database user

   (2) mysql> source demodata07.sql;

   (3) mysql> quit



Please note that this example assumes that the user and the database you

created in MySQL are called "opproject" and the SQL file "demodata07.sql".

If you used a different user name, then you have to specify this user name in

(1) after the option "-u" and a different database name after "-p".





Appendix C: Example Connect Strings for MySQL and PostgreSQL

------------------------------------------------------------



A complete discussion about JDBC connect strings is way beyond the scope of

this document, but we would like to provide you with example connect strings

for the most simple case (Tomcat and database are installed on the same

machine using their respective default port numbers).



For MySQL, the most simple connect string is:



	jdbc:mysql:///opproject

	

For PostgreSQL, the connect string is:



	jdbc:postgresql:opproject



In both cases "opproject" is the name of the database instance to connect to.

You will find more information about connect strings on the MySQL and

PostgreSQL web sites (http://www.mysql.com and http://www.postgresql.org)





Appendix D: Troubleshooting

---------------------------



* If the applet does not get loaded, but the Java Virtual Machine of the

browser is starting, please try to clear your Java cache on the client

computer. Under Windows, this can be done by going to the control panel,

selecting "Java" and then pressing the clear cache button



* If you get an error in the login screen saying that the JDBC driver was

not found then you probably forgot to copy the JDBC driver JAR file into

the WEB-INF/lib directory of the web application; please do it and restart

Tomcat afterwards in order to be sure that the JDBC driver JAR file gets

loaded correctly





Appendix E: Upgrading to a Transactional MySQL Instance

-------------------------------------------------------



We discovered that it is possible to connect Onepoint Project also to a

non-transactional MySQL instance (MyISAM), but this was never intended to

be supported or even working. Onepoint Project makes heavy use of

transactions and running it against a non-transactional database

can cause severe data inconsistencies.



Therefore, if you are running Onepoint Project against a non-transactional

database instance we strongly recommend to upgrade to a transaction database

instance via executing the following steps:



(1) Use the "Repository" tool to create an XML backup of your current project

repository. In addition, create a dump of your MySQL database instance

using the mysqldump command line utility (just in case something goes wrong).

We propose also to copy the "backup" directory from the opproject web app

directory (it contains the XML backup you just created)



(2) Stop the opproject web app or Tomcat as a whole



(3) Drop your current MySQL Onepoint Project user and database instance



(4) Reconfigure your MySQL installation "transactional only" or at least

make sure that you create the new Onepoint Project database instance for

use with transactions (use the InnoDB engine) and grant the new Onepoint

Project database user access to the new database



(5) Delete the "configuration.oxc.xml" file in order that the database

configuration wizard will show up once you start the web app



(6) Start the opproject web app or Tomcat as a whole



(7) Configure database access to the new Onepoint Project database instance

by selecting "MySQL (InnoDB)". The system will now create a clean project

repository (this might take some time)



(8) Use the "Repositoy" tool to restore the XML backup you created in (1).

If everything went well you should now have an exact copy of your project

repository, but residing in a transactional database instance
